# v3 Docs

This is the documentation for Wails v3. It is currently a work in progress.

If you do not wish to build it locally, it is available online at
[https://wailsapp.github.io/wails/](https://wailsapp.github.io/wails/).

## Recommended Setup Steps

Install the wails3 CLI if you haven't already:

```shell
go install github.com/zappie/wails/v3/cmd/wails3@latest
```

The documentation uses mkdocs, so you will need to install
[Python](https://www.python.org/). Once installed, you can setup the
documentation by running the following command:

```bash
wails3 task docs:setup
```

This will install the required dependencies for you.

If you have installed the wails3 CLI, you can run the following command to build
the documentation and serve it locally:

```bash
wails3 task docs:serve
```

### Manual Setup

To install manually, you will need to do the following:

- Install [Python](https://www.python.org/)
- Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the required dependencies
- Run `mkdocs serve` to serve the documentation locally
- Run `mkdocs build` to build the documentation
